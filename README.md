Was an assignment to build a voting application. This was before I knew AJAX so some of the pages are made to use a simple refresh to see updated/ live results.

May eventually make a newer version of this in the future using newer skills gain, e.g. use AJAX and Thymeleaf templating engine instead of jsp pages.
